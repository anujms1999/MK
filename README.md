Description
===========
A numerical predictive tool for forming limit diagram on the basis of macro-mechanical constitutive description
using 1) isotropic hardening; 2) yield function; 3) associnated flow rule.




Features
========
Modulized Python functions for various anisotropic yield functions: Hill48, YLD2000-2D.
Easy to characterize the anisotropic coefficients need for yield functions.
